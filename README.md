# Madhvani_Group_Application

A) Project Goals

Madhvani Group is a standalone application that will provide users with simplified e-commerce shopping experience. 
To get desired functionality, Madhvani Group Application will have one main component in the form of a client which will connect to multiple cloud services. The client will be responsible for all user interface components (registration, login, ordering, and mobile money payment) and communication between the cloud services (MTN mobile money API, Google Maps API, Firebase) through SDKs. The cloud services will then manage data, client connections, and user requests by using their respective development tools/services.

This application will most certainly solve our clientâ€™s challenge with the Time-consuming movements to physically place orders and stressful queuing for payments.  

B) Product Functionality

1. Take online orders from clients 

2. Take payments using MTN mobile money
	
3. Track delivery of products to clients

D) User Interfaces

a) Home Page:

Before accessing the Home Page, the user is first authenticated. The user then proceeds to the home page which indicates a variety of products that are provided by the suppliers.

The products are categorised into different sets of products such that product navigation is made simpler for the user.


b) Item Search and View:
When the user clicks the Search icon in the top right corner, he/she is then able to fill in text in a search bar for a specific item he/she is looking for.

They can then click on the product which allows him to view the product in the Item View section.

When user clicks the View Product Button, the app proceeds to the next interface which allows him to Buy Product or Add to Cart, which allows for multiple additions of various products.


c) Product Confirmation and Payment:

After the User is done selecting the products, he/she proceeds to the Confirmation Page, where he/she can checkout the product in case they are satisfied with what is shown.

The user is then proceeded to the payment page where their location is detected automatically and they can choose among the different hotspots where they want their product to be delivered
